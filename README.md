## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-shoe-store-backend.git
   ```

### 2. Open the Project in an IDE
Open the project folder in your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or Eclipse. Import it as a Maven project to ensure dependencies are automatically downloaded. Confirm that the IDE recognizes it as a Spring Boot project. All Maven dependencies should be listed under the pom.xml file.

Additional Steps for IntelliJ IDEA:
Go to File > Project Structure and ensure that Project SDK is set to your Java SDK.
Navigate to Run > Edit Configurations..., and set the Main class as com.yourpackage.ShoemanagementApplication (replace yourpackage with the actual package name).
Set the Working Directory to $MODULE_WORKING_DIR$ to ensure view files are loaded correctly.

### 3. Configure the Database
Edit src/main/resources/application.properties to match your MySQL setup:

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:3306/shoe_management?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
```

Credentials: Update the username and password in application.properties to match your MySQL setup.
Initialize the Database: Seed the database with base data if required for initial testing.
Project Structure
Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and route data to the service layer.
Models: Define data entities and relationships.
Views: Display data retrieved by controllers.
Project Workflow
This backend is organized with the following structure:

Controllers: Manage requests, handle user input, and route to views.
Models: Define the data structure for the application.
Views: Format and display data as needed by the application.

### Additional Information
This project is designed with maintainability in mind, using service classes for reusability and DAO classes for direct database interaction. Some features, like the cart functionality, are still in progress, making this project ideal for contributions or further enhancements.

### Project Summary
This backend enables full functionality for a 3D shoe store, including product, employee, and sales management, with future expansions for a customer cart and enhanced security.
